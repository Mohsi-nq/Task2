# Task2
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains task 2 of my AI & Machine Learning internship, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset.

---

##  Objective

Perform EDA to explore the dataset and uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between features to prepare for future machine learning tasks.

---

Task Steps

### 1. Generate Summary Statistics

### 2. Create Histograms and Boxplots
- **Histograms:** Show distribution of numeric features
- **Boxplots:** Help detect outliers

### 3. Use Pairplot / Correlation Matrix
- **Seaborn pairplot:** Visualize relationships between features
- **Heatmap:** Display correlation values for numerical features

### 4. Identify Patterns, Trends, or Anomalies
- Examples:
  - Higher survival rate among 1st class passengers
  - Women had better survival chances
  - Age and Fare show skewed distributions

### 5. Make Basic Feature-Level Inferences from Visuals
- **Pclass vs Survived:** Clear pattern of higher survival in 1st class
- **Sex vs Survived:** Females survived more than males
- **Fare vs Survived:** Higher fare often linked to survival
